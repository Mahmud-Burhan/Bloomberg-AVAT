## How to use the project
1. This project is made as simple as possible as it is intended for personal usage.
2. The source code is made to be ran basically inside a Jupyter Notebook, which will then produce AVAT graphs.
3. Any valid stocks' ticker from yfinance API could be used, and interval days range are valid from 1-730 (depends on yfinance interval API).
4. These AVAT graphs can then be consumed to help with investment decisions (this is not a financial advice).
